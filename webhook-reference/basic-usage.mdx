## Who is this for?
You **work with returns data** for a Shopify brand. You are most likely a developer that works directly for a brand, or at a B2B company which works with brands (3PL, WMS, CX automation, etc.)


## Preview

Look how easy it is to setup a webhook subscription:

![Webhook subscription UI example](/images/webhook-example.png)

With this setup, whenever a [ReturnGroup](/api-reference/endpoints/return-groups) is created, a POST request to the provided Callback URL will be sent with the following headers:

```json
{
    "Frate-Signature-Hmac-Sha256": <HMAC_SIGNATURE>,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

And the following data:

```json
{
    "topic": "return.created",
    "data": <RETURN_GROUP_PAYLOAD>,
},
```

It is the responsibility of the webhook receiver (you) to setup a callback URL to receive these webhook events, and to implement HMAC verification on the events to ensure that they are coming from Frate.

## Topics

The available topics are:
1. `return.created`
2. `return.updated`
3. `return.canceled`
4. `return.flagged`
5. `refund.created`
6. `exchange.hold_released`
7. `exchange.canceled`
8. `label.scanned`

The topics define the trigger of the webhook event, and all topics will return the [ReturnGroup](/api-reference/endpoints/return-groups) data structure in the `data` field of the webhook event payload.
